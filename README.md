# Power real-time journeys and batch campaigns with AJO

Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) lets you orchestrate and deliver personalized customer engagement across all channels — including email, web, app, mobile and in-person — in the moments that matter to the customer.
AJO is an app built on top of Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), it leverages Adobe Real Time Customer Profile to power digital experiences.  With AEP and AJO,  you'll then be able to : 
- Collect data in real time through Adobe Experience SDKs and APIs and articulate those touchpoints altogether to build powerful customer journeys.
- Decide which customer behaviors should be heard and react accordingly to determine the new best interaction between your contacts and your brand.
- Build complex customer journeys with a graphical orchestrator and deliver  personalized, just in time messages.
- Create campaigns to deliver personalized communications across your own inbound and outbound channels and ensure a true consistent experience to all your customers.

---

During this lab, we will use a fictitious sports equipment brand - called **Luma** - to illustrate these capabilities through 3 chapters:

- **Acquisition of new customer data** from the Luma website. Thanks to real-time collection, we will collect visitors interactions, even anonymous ones. When a user creates its account, its anonymous activity will be automatically linked to its known profile and will complete the 360° view of the contact in Adobe Experience Platform.

- **Conversion and cart abandonment**. By using the orchestration engine, we will define personalized messages at each stage of the online payment process. From adding a product to a cart to finalizing the payment, we will interact through personalized communications with our future customers, and also retarget them if they do not complete the purchase process.

- **Promotional Campaign**. We’d also like to build a campaign to promote the new Luma Fall Collection. This campaign will display a banner on the website to invite visitors to look at the Fall Collection landing page.



# Learning objectives
- Generate behavioral data from the Luma website and appreciate how they contribute to the real-time profile and identity graph in Adobe Experience Platform
- Prepare a customer journey built using AJO orchestration canvas and craft personalized communications with all the functionalities  AJO offers such as templates, fragments, translations, pressure rule and much more.
- Create marketing campaigns activating audiences calculated by AEP, ensuring the consistency of communications in a fully omnichannel way.
- Track the performance of your marketing actions and your A/B tests through dashboards and delivery reports.



# Prerequisites
- A web browser with internet access **opened in incognito mode**, this is to avoid mixing with potential browser extension that may alter the lab experience.
- You are going to use your email address as lab participant identifier. This is the one you share when registering to this event.
- An access to your mailbox to check your emails.



# Exercices
We prepared 3 exercices to help you understand all the benefits AJO offers when bringing a customer journey to life. As we have a couple of hours only, we cannot cover them all, but we'll focus on the business persona rather than the technical role. In these exercices, you'll be in the marketeer shoes and your goal will be to prepare a campaign for Luma, our fictitious sport apparel brand. The lab is composed of 3 chapters : 

[Acquisition](./acquisition.md): Navigate the demo website and generate data to then visualize it in Adobe Experience Platform.

[Conversion](./conversion.md): Configure the purchasing journey and its different stages, from checkout to payment, including retargeting abandoners.

[Batch Campaign](./campaign.md): Create an batch campaign to target your visitors on the website, based on their browsing interest and display a banner on the home page of Luma website to promote the fall outdoor gear  collection.
